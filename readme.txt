project:
Build a plot where you fit a regression line for the ‘accuracy’ column with a feature you find sensible and motivate your choice.
Look at the responses of men and women using only answers of people from your country (or as a backup, pick Turkey). 
Test whether men and women provide different answers to 5 questions of your choice.


dataset:
csv file
mixed data types


work done:
I chose to use the chi2 because it is dealing with categorical data. 
although the answers are numerical but they represent some sort of category. for instance 1 could be : very low and 5 would be: very high
in conclusion, the p values are all above 0.05. in chi2 we need them to be less than 0.05 to say that they are dependent. 
I am going to fail to reject the hypothesis by saying that the gender and the answers to the questions do not seem to be dependent but we need more evidence to confirm they are dependent.
